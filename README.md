# MVC-and-Rest-try

after building a rest and a mvc i decided to combine those two here down find the description 
these are exercises and way of understanding concept 

building my own Api from scratch 

The aim of the project is to create a distributed system that uses REST API for communication between system components in any technology (i used PHP). 

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: 

The online auction system should enable users to list and bid on items in various categories. All data should be stored in a permanent manner (XML, database). When designing and implementing, the MVC or equivalent model must be strictly adhered to. 

 

1. Create a REST API that allows you to support users: 

a. Adding a user 

b. Editing a user 

c. Deleting a User 

d. Retrieving user information 

2. Create a REST API that allows you to handle auctions: 

a. Adding an item to an auction 

b. Editing an item for bidding 

c. Removing an item from the auction 

d. Downloading information about the item at the auction 

3. Create a REST API that will allow you to make a payment for the auctioned item - in this case, use the sanbox of the selected payment operator 

4. Create an interface that allows you to conduct auctions in the selected technology 

 

The functionalities listed with individual tasks are only illustrative and do not constitute full functionality


there were the requirements and we tried to solve it


## for the API 

for the api to work properly , the main folder must have Qwerty as name and inside this folder opern another one named : nextbid-auction-website-main where you can deploy all files and run it properly or modify the directory of the api file in your code
